# 🚀 Node File Manager

A simple and powerful File Management Application built using **Node.js, Express, and EJS**.

This project performs full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations without using any database.  
Instead of MongoDB or SQL, it uses the **Node.js File System (fs module)** to manage files directly from the server.
